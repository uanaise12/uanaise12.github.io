		<section class="design-process">
			<h2>Background Research</h2>

			<h3> About our Client</h3>
			Our end user was an 18-year-old male who suffered a gunshot wound and had a stroke. This affected his spinal
			cord and, by extension, mobility in his left hand and below the waist.
			He could only manage minor movements in his left uppr arm and elbow.<br>

			<h3>Secondary Research</h3>
			<p>
				My teammates and I conducted interviews and web research to better
				understand the problem and the needs of our users. Our target was to find out what solutions already
				exist,
				and the limitations that prevent them from satisfying our client's needs.
			</p>
			<h4>Existing Solutions</h4>
			<p>
				During our initial research, we discovered that the existing can openers either require the use of both
				hands
				to open. Some of the gripping solutions available are intended to add leverage for people who have
				mobility
				in both hands, therefore, our user would not be able to use them.

			<h3>Project Partner Interview</h3><br>
			<p>
				We interviewed occupational therapists Randi Applehans and Meghan Griffin via Zoom to gain deeper
				insight into the specific needs and daily challenges faced by our end user. This conversation helped us
				understand his capabilities and everyday environment, hence informing our design decisions.

					Key design considerations identified during our interview include:
				</p>
				<ul>
					<li>Adaptability to different container sizes</li>
					<li>Operation requiring less than 10 pounds of grip strength</li>
					<li>Single-handed usability</li>
					<li>Compact design for easy transportation in a backpack</li>
					<li>Safety and comfort for regular daily use</li>

		<!-- User Interview Summary -->
		<section class="user-interview">
			<h3>User Observation & Experimentation</h3><br>
			<article class="interview2">
				<p>
					To better inform our design, we conducted user observation sessions focusing on both Chris (our end
					user) and our team's experiences when opening jars.</p><br>
				<h4>Observing the End User</h4>
				<p>
					We reviewed four short videos provided by our project partners showing Chris attempting to open
					various
					containers. These observations revealed:
				</p><br>
				<ul>
					<li>Difficulty firmly gripping and stabilizing containers</li>
					<li>Limited success using methods such as the elbow crease and sticky materials (dycem)</li>
					<li>Consistent struggles due to reduced grip strength and mobility limitations</li>
				</ul><br>
				<h4>Self-Observation</h4>
				<p>
					Our team conducted controlled self-observations to simulate Chris's physical limitations. We tested
					opening various containers—medication bottles, a water bottle, deodorant, hand sanitizer, and
					jars—using
					both one-handed and two-handed methods.<br>
					Our findings showed that larger lids and containers were particularly challenging to open with one
					hand due to difficulty maintaining a stable grip and generating enough twisting force.

			<h2>The Design</h2><br>
			<p>
				Our design, Ajar, is a removable attachment to his wheelchair arm that stabilizes containers of
				everyday use. Ajar has cup holders of multiple sizes designed to stabilize the base of any container
				the user may need to open.
			</p><br>
			<div class="images-row">
				<figure>
					<img src="attach-wheelchair.png" alt="A diagram of Ajar secured to the left wheelchair arm">
					<figcaption>Ajar secured to the left wheelchair arm
					</figcaption><br>
				</figure>
			</div>
			<p>
				Ajar has four jar holders with the dimensions of 4.4375, 3.376, 2.313, and
				1.250 inches in diameter. These hole diameters match those of a peanut butter jar, a medicine bottle,
				and two values in between
			</p><br>

					<img src="measurements.png" alt="A top view of Ajar">
					<figcaption>A top view of Ajar
					</figcaption><br>
				</figure>
			</div>
			<p>
				Ajar's primary material is polyurethane. Rubber lining throughout the points of contact between the
				device and containers creates added grip strength and provides additional safety
			</p><br>

		<!-- Iteration -->
		<section class="Testing">
			<h2>Performance Testing</h2><br>
			<div class="testing-row">
				<p>
					To evaluate our final design, we conducted a survey-based performance test involving potential
					stakeholders, including intended users and their support networks. The survey explored the
					intuitiveness, design effectiveness, and feasibility of our device, Ajar.<br>

					Participants were first shown an unlabeled image of the device to assess initial intuitiveness,
					followed by a labeled image to gather feedback on component clarity and overall design
					understanding.
				</p><br>
				<h4>Key Findings</h4>
				<ul>
					<li>Most participants intuitively understood Ajar's purpose from the initial unlabeled image</li>
					<li>Concerns were raised about the ease of twisting the knob used for clamping and securely
						attaching the device to the wheelchair</li>
					<li>Some participants suggested that ergonomic issues related to reaching across the wheelchair
						might arise</li>
				</ul>
