			<h2>Initial Approach & Methodology</h2> <br>
			The original requirement was to make something that gives advice to people from multiple perspectives.
			My teammates and I came up with a simple list of user needs and approaches to satisfy them. These
			included:<br><br>
			<ul>
				<li>A user should be able to enter a prompt</li>
				<li>User privacy</li>
				<li>User history should be kept</li>
				<li>A system that generates three perspectives for a provided prompt</li>
				<li>A personalized system that learns from the user's preferences</li>
			</ul><br>
			At this stage, our persective scale ranged from optimistic to neutral to pessimistic. We mapped out the
			requirements and matched them to the desired functionalities and any potential technological tools required.

			<h2>Iterations</h2> <br>
			Our framework initially relied on the OpenAI API to generate all outputs based on a single prompt. However,
			we quickly realized that we needed tighter and more specific constraints to achieve optimal results. Over
			the course of two months, we implemented the following changes: <br> <br>
			<ul>
				<li><strong>Narrowing Down the User Scope</strong><br> Targeting a broad audience proved too unfocused
					and
					did not guarantee accurate, relevant outcomes. Therefore, we decided to focus on business leaders
					and managers, who frequently face complex, high-stakes decisions. </li><br>
				<li><strong>Refining Perspective Generation</strong><br> Our initial approach used optimistic, neutral,
					and
					pessimistic viewpoints, which became less relevant for our new, more specialized user group. As a
					result, we removed that framework and prompted the LLM to generate three perspectives tailored to
					each specific input. </li><br>
				<li><strong>Restricting the LLM</strong><br> Since users could enter a wide variety of prompts, we
					introduced filters to block input unrelated to business advice and decision-making, ensuring more
					focused and useful output.</li><br>
				<li><strong>Comparison Effect</strong><br> Comparing diverse perspectives is essential for effective
					decision-making. We added a side-by-side view to let users easily compare and contrast different
					insights. Additionally, we included a SWOT analysis
					for each generated perspective to facilitate more straightforward evaluation.</li><br>
				<li><strong>Action and Tracking</strong><br> Some recommendations require implementation over time with
					multiple steps. To address this, we created a dedicated page for any chosen perspective, allowing
					users to follow actionable steps and track their progress. </li><br>
			</ul>

			<h2>Personal Contribution</h2> <br>
			<ul>
				<li>Worked on the integration of OpenAI into our website. This included making te necessary changes in
					the prompt,
					setting up request sending to the API, and putting the output into a suitable format for the
					frontend. </li>
				<li> Added the SWOT Analysis functionality for each perspective, making sure to pass in summarized
					perspective-specific advice for quick generation.</li>
				<li>Presented different versions of the website alongside my teammates.</li>
				<li>Helped with setting up the 'Tracking and Actionable Items' part of the website.</li>
