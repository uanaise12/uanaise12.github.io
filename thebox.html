		<section class="design-process">
			<h2>Background Research</h2>
			<h3>Our Users</h3>
			<p>
				Our primary end users are the aging population or, as described by our project partners, “baby boomers”
				(people born in 1946-1964).
			</p>
			<h3>Secondary Research</h3>
			<p>
				We watched various videos and read articles about the physical exercises recommended for middle-aged
				people. Those exercises include light weight-lifting, running, yoga, cardio, and more.

			<h4>Existing Solutions</h4>
			<p>
				We explored several existing at-home exercise tools to better understand current options available to
				older adults. It quickly became clear that many of these solutions aren't tailored specifically to the
				unique needs and limitations of our target demographic. </p>

			<h3>User Interview Insights</h3>
			<article class="interview">
				<p>
					We conducted interviews with two older adults to better understand their specific needs and
					motivations.<br><br>

					<strong>Ms. Cindy Stewart (age 68)</strong> highlighted the value of personal interest in
					maintaining motivation:
					<italicized> “Exercising feels much easier when it includes activities I genuinely enjoy. Maybe a
						reward system
						would also help keep me going.”</italicized> She prefers workouts that are engaging without
					becoming overly
					demanding.<br><br>

					<strong>Ms. Eleanor (age 72)</strong> discussed practical factors like affordability and
					versatility: <italicized>"I'd love
						something versatile for different exercises—but it needs to fit my budget."</italicized> She
					currently performs
					simple stretches at her kitchen counter and uses specialized equipment for balance during physical
					therapy.

			<h2>The Design</h2><br>
			<p>
				The Box is a fitness design that motivates and educates users 65 years and older who are impacted by
				lack of exercise and aging. The wooden box is supported with two hand railings to aid the user in doing
				tricky and more hazardous movements.

					</figcaption><br>

			</div><br>
			<p>
				The box also has rubber on the edges to add friction so the box does not slip and cause damage to the
				user.

				</figure>
			</div>
			<p>
				Finally, there is a QR code on the side of the box that a user will scan once they have the box. This
				will take
				them to a set of videos where they can pick from a multitude of different types of exercises.

			<h2>Testing</h2><br>
			<h3>User Survey Results</h3><br>
			<p>
				We conducted a survey with 23 participants aged 65 or above to gather feedback on our design.
				Participants overwhelmingly preferred instructional videos as the most effective medium for learning new
				exercises, with a clear preference for accessing these through QR codes. Most respondents found our
				design intuitive and effective for exercising, though some suggested additional features for improved
				motivation and usability.

			<h2>User Testing & Results</h2>
			<p>
				Finally, we conducted user testing sessions to gather feedback on our prototype, capturing initial
				impressions and identifying areas for improvement. Generally, there were positive reactions toward the
				aesthetics, ergonomic benefits, and integrated video instructions of our prototype. However, users
				expressed safety concerns about rotating handles, handle stability, and the box's tendency to slip
				during use.

							<th>What do you think about our prototype?</th>
							<th>Any concerns about the prototype?</th>
						</tr>

						<tr>
							<td>User 1</td>
							<td>I like the aesthetics. It’s a cool design.</td>
							<td>The handles rotate, might cause accidents</td>
						</tr>
						<tr>
							<td>User 2</td>
							<td>I like the fact that you can do pushups on it without having to bend your back so much.
								I think that this will be really helpful for older people</td>
							<td>Handles seem a bit unstable</td>
						</tr>

							<td>User 3</td>
							<td>The design looks nice. I like the video part too.”</td>

		<!-- Iteration -->
		<section class="iteration">
			<h2>Iteration</h2>
			<p>
				Through user and self-testing, We discovered that applying too much pressure caused the bars to rotate,
				potentially posing safety
				risks. To address this issue, we added rectangular wooden supports on each side of the bars, effectively
				stabilizing them and preventing unintended movement.
